## React Job Application Tracker

### Purpose of the app:
To offer a single page app for users to keep track of all of their pending job applications.

### Technologies used:
* Node
* React
* Lodash
* Material-UI

### Known issues (to be fixed)
* Web app is not responsive, so smaller browser windows will break the layout.
* Currently only a front-end app, and as such, data will be lost between page visits.
* No user-login functionality yet. Will be added in at the same time the back-end is built.

If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork and make changes. I believe with a few iterative changes this app would be very helpful for job-seekers.
